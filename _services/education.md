Education plays a crucial role in our work of restoring mangrove forests in Indonesia. As we work with local communities to implement large-scale restoration projects, we recognize the need to educate community members on the importance of mangrove forests and the benefits they provide. Through educational programs and workshops, we aim to raise awareness about the vital role mangrove forests play in protecting against climate change and providing livelihoods for local communities.

We believe that empowering communities with knowledge and skills is key to achieving sustainable and long-lasting restoration. By providing education on topics such as sustainable land management and agroforestry, we can equip communities with the tools they need to continue the work of restoration beyond our initial efforts. Through education, we can work together with local communities to ensure the preservation and restoration of mangrove forests in Indonesia for generations to come.
