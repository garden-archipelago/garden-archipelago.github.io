# Why reforest in Indonesia?

Indonesia is one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet and home to about 23% of the world’s mangrove forests. However, in the last 50 years, Indonesia has lost over 40% of its mangrove forests. It is also consistently ranked in the top three countries for the highest rate of deforestation. The effects of deforestation have significantly impacted indigenous communities, who are often the first to feel the negative effects of climate change.

# How we started

In 2017, we began working to restore mangrove forests in the Saireri region of Papua, Indonesia. Partnering with the local foundation, Yayasan Reboisasi Eden Papua (YREP), we worked alongside Kementrian Lingkungan Hidup dan Kehutanan (Indonesia’s Ministry of Forestry) and partnered with 21 various communities to plant 16,723,000 trees at 11 different sites. 

# Where we are headed

In 2023 we moved out from under the management of Eden Reforestation Projects to foster a more locally-driven restoration initiative with a plan to expand projects to other islands across the country. 

# Where

Currently, Garden Archipelago is based in Biak Numfor regency in the province of Papua, eastern Indonesia. The foundation has operated in Supiori, Yapen, Seram, and other islands with plans to launch projects in the Maluku region. 

# Plant

Having many years of experience and credibility through our work with local communities in remote parts of Indonesia, Garden Archipelago sees the communities we work with as the driving force for restoration. Collaboratively, we work to plant and protect millions of trees a year. In fact, since 2019, through our partnership with Eden Reforestation Projects, we have planted more than 16 million trees!

# Protect

After a tree is planted, it must be protected until it reaches maturity to maximize its environmental impact and to ensure it sequesters as much Carbon as possible. Through our partnership with Eden Reforestation Projects, we were able to

# Empower

By actively involving and empowering local communities, we will foster a sense of ownership and stewardship over their natural surroundings. Through community development initiatives, community members will gain the knowledge, skills, and resources necessary to actively participate in restoration efforts, ensuring the sustainability of our projects in the long run. Education, on the other hand, plays a transformative role by raising awareness about the value of biodiversity, the impacts of environmental degradation, and the importance of conservation. Garden Archipelago will organize community outreach programs to engage with local schools and organizations, educating them about the importance of sustainability and diversity and how they can get involved.
