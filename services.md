# How to Support our Work

We believe that successful restoration and conservation efforts require collaborative partnerships. At Garden Archipelago, we invite individuals, organizations, businesses, and communities to join us in our mission to restore and protect Indonesia's diverse landscapes. Together, we can make a tangible difference in safeguarding the country's unique biodiversity. Whether you are a conservation enthusiast, a corporate entity with a commitment to sustainability, a local community passionate about preserving your natural surroundings, or an organization seeking meaningful collaborations, we welcome your support. By becoming a partner of The Garden Archipelago Foundation, you can actively contribute to restoration projects, provide resources and expertise, or support our initiatives through funding and sponsorship. Join us in this important endeavor as we work hand in hand with local communities to restore Indonesia's ecosystems, through reforestation, conservation, and education. Contact us to find out how you can support our work.
