# You support, we empower to plant

Indonesia, being one of the world's most significant biodiversity hotspots with over 17,000 islands, is comprised of diverse ecosystems. Ranging from lush rainforests to stunning coral reefs, the Indonesian archipelago is truly a lush garden of diversity. Unfortunately, deforestation, habitat loss, and climate change pose huge threats to this fragile ecosystem that so many call home. Garden Archipelago is restoring native landscapes through targeted interventions. Contact us to find out how you can participate.
